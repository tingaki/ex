â–  Code files are divided into four parts:

Part 1: Compilation of raw data (in STATA).

Part 2: Estimation of the proportion of delivering mothers who adopt IVF in the mother group indexed by age (a) and family wealth-rank (w) in period (t) using Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS) regression (in STATA).

Part 3: Estimation of the gender preference parameters of first-birth mothers who adopt IVFs (using Maximum Likelihood Estimation, MLE, in R).

Part 4: Calculation of the MLE standard errors of parameters and the values used in Figures 3 and 4 based on the estimates obtained from Part 3 (in STATA).
